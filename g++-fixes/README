G++ has a certain number of bugs in it, which may cause problems
when you compile XOOPIC.  These are some of them and their work arounds:

Problem				Workaround
--------------------------------------------------------------------
xoopic compile fails due	get cstring.h from this directory
to errors in cstring.h		and replace 
				/usr/local/lib/g++-include/std/cstring.h
				with cstring.h in this directory.
				This may break other things, but
				XOOPIC will compile.
