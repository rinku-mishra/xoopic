The input files in this directory
were used to collect the data points on the plot
"dispersion.eps".

A plasma density of 1e20 was used
(wp = 5.63494e+11) in each case, while
a y-polarized plane-wave was input from the left
and its wavelength measured.

The raw measured data is in
"rawdata.dat", with the same data 
rearranged in "wp_vs_k.dat".

"theory.dat" contains the theoretical
dispersion curve for this density.
