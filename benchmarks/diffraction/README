General notes:

  The measurement technique for calculating the beam waist was
changed.  The files:
        EE2.ps.gz
        EE.ps.gz
        param_compare2.ps.gz
        param_compare.ps.gz

show results using this new method, compared with results from
the old method and with theory.  Other .ps.gz files have
no such results. 

gauss1a.inp, gauss1b.inp, gauss1bp.inp
example input files, not actually used.


gauss_1.inp:  Input file actually used to generate results
gauss_1p.inp:   gauss_1.inp with a plasma
gauss_1p*  Various input files used.

interfere.inp:  interference pattern

*.agr:  xmgrace graph files of results
*.ps.gz:  compressed postscript graphs of results
Results:  Results of measurements.
