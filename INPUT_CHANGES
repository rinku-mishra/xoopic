Version 2.0 to version 3.0?

Multiple spatial regions added:
all groups must be surrounded by
Region
{
other groups
}
except Variables and the description

________________________________________________________________
Feature-added changes:

Variables group added.  User may define variables at the
top of an input file which may be used throughout the input file.

Grid: User-given functional modulation of grid spacing added.

Control:  User-given functional distribution of static magnetic
field in space added.

Species:  supercycle of particles allowed
	particleLimit added, max # of particles by species

Load:  units added, input in either MKS or eV supported
	analyticF added, user-given function distribution of particles
	Thermal cutoffs and velocities added

Generic Boundary Parameters:
	Lines do not necessarily have to be horizontal in some cases
	Specification of boundary endpoints in MKS units allowed
	F added for user-given functional time dependence on boundary
	reflection added
	refMaxE added

CurrentRegion group added

	
Generic Emitter Parameters:
	most thermal velocities set here now
	np2c added


Version 2.0 to version 3.0?

Boundaries all can take Segment subgroup to describe their
endpoints, and some of them (Equipotential, Conductor,
Foil, Polar) can take multiple Segments.
