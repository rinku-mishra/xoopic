MovingWindow
{

  This input file shows an example of a beam moving in a uniform background.
the geometry is r-z, cylindrical.  All the edges are bounded with conductors:
these boundaries are necessary.

  The initial load consists of stationary deuterium along with protons
moving to the right with v1drift = 3.e9.  This is in units of EV, so I
(JRC) assume that v1drift is actually the momentum in the 1-direction.

  A special load named shiftLoad (its parameter Name = shiftLoad) is executed
whenever a shift of the window occurs.  This special load in this example
loads a uniform plasma into the last cell, which is initially empty when
the moving window shifts.

  The movingWindow has a hard-coded delay time before it starts shifting, 
something like 1/2 or 2/3 of a lightspeed transit time across the system.

  Also, the moving window motion is hard-coded to move to the right, so
rightward-moving particles will stay in the window.  Everything else will
seem to move left.
