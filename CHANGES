CHANGES to XOOPIC

XOOPIC 2.7 -- Requires concurrent 2.7 XGrafix, later than June 10, 2010
o Mostly various compile and link bugfixes for modern compilers and systems

XOOPIC 2.5 --  Requires XGrafix version later than Mar. 29, 2005.

o	fixing routines converting particles' velocity into their
	energy and gamma to be correct in both relativistic and
	non-relativistic regimes
o	moving window added.
o	analytic initial fields added to Control
o	bugfix to plasma source
o	bugfix to exitport:  dump/restore stored the wrong fields.
o	changing the save file name in the GUI is now recognized
        by xoopic
o	dump file format changed to better support multiprocessing

XOOPIC 2.1

o	Secondary subgroup added to Dielectric, allowing most boundaries to 
	have multiple incident species unduce secondary emission.
o	Energy threshold added for secondary emission.
o	Freeze Fields.

XOOPIC 2.0  8/20/97  --  Requires Xgrafix Ver. 2.4

o Equation parser/evaluator
o Timefunctions via evaluator
o Magnetic field via evaluator
o Load/PlasmaSource via evaluator
o Named variables in input file
o EM damping
o Dielectric triangular region
o Oblique equipotentials
o Dielectric::reflection
o equation parse for grid setup
o oblique beam emitter and var wt bm emitter
o supercycling (for low-space charge species which must be pushed 
  faster than electrostatic fields change due to particle Courant)
o MCC package flexibility improved; see gas.inp for example
o MCC package can handle multiple (noble) gases
o Input file format changed, for emitters, vzdrift -->  v1drift,
  and other variables similarly to better support multiple geometries.
  The following definitions where used to define the temperature:
	temperature: 3/2 kT = 1/2 m (Vtx^2+Vty^2+Vtz^2) = 1/2 m Vt^2
	v1thermal:  1/2 kT = 1/2 m Vtx^2	
	v2thermal:  1/2 kT = 1/2 m Vty^2
	v3thermal:  1/2 kT = 1/2 m Vtz^2
o Current Regions: given currents in regions and lines.
o Input file changed to allow multiple spatial regions
o Subgroups added
o Conductor, equipotential, polarizer, foil boundaries
  can be multi-segment.
o Multiple gas packages possible (see MCC in input.txt)
