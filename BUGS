Bug #2

All platforms.

The number density plot is upside-down for negatively charged species.
The numbers reported are correct, however.



Bug/Feature #3

Electrostatic simulations only

All platforms.  If you put two equipotential surfaces on top of each
other, you'll get a possibly unintended poisson solution.  This is a 
consequence
of the decomposition of the fields solution (see the algorithm manual)
into a poisson solution and a laplace solution for each of the equipotentials.
The laplace solution is computed separately for each equipotential,
and they'll superimpose.  If you have two equipotentials on top of each
other, the potential near them might be double what you expect.


Bug #4  -- XGRAFIX

Two windows with exactly the same title will cause XGrafix 2.0 to
behave in a weird fashion.


Bug #5 -- hollow.inp

gives this warning:

warning: segment in boundary Noname at (0, 32)- (35, 32) has normal directed outside the region

Bug #6--  ambipolar.inp -- DADI does something funny with the
corner.

Bug #7-- ToNodes does not take into account charge on the wall.

Bug #8-- 
	emit should be put inside push loop, emit does not know about species
	maybe species should be passed into emit so that it emits the same species
	that is being pushed.

Bug/Feature #9
	should steperate input file diag from the rest of the diag so that the
	default diag are not done with -nox option

Bug/Feature #10 
	 EM boundary cond crash in applyFields on alphas when runing ES field solve 
	because of Arithmetic exception.
