The input files in here are used for the purposes of benchmarking
XOOPIC or OOPIC.

Please read the top of each input file for instructions on how
to run them.

If you run these benchmarks, please send the results to 
peterm@langmuir.eecs.berkeley.edu, so that I may
include the results in XOOPIC_TIMINGS
