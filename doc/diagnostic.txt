Diagnostic can form three type of graphs.  Graphing the value of of
VarName.

Spatial regions
    if (j1,k1) and (j2,k2) form the corners of a rectangle then the graph
is X versus Y or R versus Z.  These is good for plotting the time average 
of variable.

Time history of a line
    if (j1,k1) and (j2,k2) form the ends of a line.  Then the graph is
a time history of the variable versus position along the line.  

Time history of a point
    if (j1,k1) and (j2,k2) is the same point then the graph is a time history
is the variable at that point.

Time histories
    The time histories is HistMax long.  When the array is full and  
Comb is defined then the array is combed to every comb'th value.  
If Comb is 0 then the array is a moving window.  
The Ave data points are averaged if Ave is set to a non zero value.
