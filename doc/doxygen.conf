# Doxyfile 1.8.10
# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# To see default options, generate template config (doxygen -g <file-name>).
# Only changes from default options are listed in this file.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8
PROJECT_NAME           = "XOOPIC"

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = ./

# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all
# inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those
# members were ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment
# operators of the base classes will not be shown.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB  = YES

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make doxygen treat a
# multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// comments) as
# a brief description. This used to be the default behavior. The new default is
# to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed description. Set this
# tag to YES if you prefer the old behavior instead.
#
# Note that setting this tag to YES also means that rational rose comments are
# not recognized any more.
# The default value is: NO.

MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES, all private members of a class will
# be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PACKAGE tag is set to YES, all members with package or internal
# scope will be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PACKAGE        = YES

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

# The WARN_LOGFILE tag can be used to specify a file to which warning and error
# messages should be written. If left blank the output is written to standard
# error (stderr).

WARN_LOGFILE           = doxygen-warning.log

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = ../

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will be
# generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.
#
# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure that
# also VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.
# The default value is: NO.

SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES

# Setting the INLINE_SOURCES tag to YES will include the body of functions,
# classes and enums directly into the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

INLINE_SOURCES         = YES

# Setting the STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS tag to YES will instruct doxygen to hide any
# special comment blocks from generated source code fragments. Normal C, C++ and
# Fortran comments will always remain visible.
# The default value is: YES.

STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS    = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate HTML output
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_HTML          = YES

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. If a
# relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of
# it.
# The default directory is: html.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_OUTPUT            = xoopic-source-reference-html

# If the HTML_TIMESTAMP tag is set to YES then the footer of each generated HTML
# page will contain the date and time when the page was generated. Setting this
# to YES can help to show when doxygen was last run and thus if the
# documentation is up to date.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_TIMESTAMP         = YES

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML
# documentation will contain sections that can be hidden and shown after the
# page has loaded.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS  = YES


# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
# the same information as the tab index, you could consider setting
# DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

# Enable the USE_MATHJAX option to render LaTeX formulas using MathJax (see
# http://www.mathjax.org) which uses client side Javascript for the rendering
# instead of using pre-rendered bitmaps. Use this if you do not have LaTeX
# installed or if you want to formulas look prettier in the HTML output. When
# enabled you may also need to install MathJax separately and configure the path
# to it using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

USE_MATHJAX            = YES

# When MathJax is enabled you can set the default output format to be used for
# the MathJax output. See the MathJax site (see:
# http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/output.html) for more details.
# Possible values are: HTML-CSS (which is slower, but has the best
# compatibility), NativeMML (i.e. MathML) and SVG.
# The default value is: HTML-CSS.
# This tag requires that the tag USE_MATHJAX is set to YES.

MATHJAX_FORMAT         = NativeMML

# Configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = YES

# The PAPER_TYPE tag can be used to set the paper type that is used by the
# printer.
# Possible values are: a4 (210 x 297 mm), letter (8.5 x 11 inches), legal (8.5 x
# 14 inches) and executive (7.25 x 10.5 inches).
# The default value is: a4.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

PAPER_TYPE             = letter

# If the LATEX_BATCHMODE tag is set to YES, doxygen will add the \batchmode
# command to the generated LaTeX files. This will instruct LaTeX to keep running
# if errors occur, instead of asking the user for help. This option is also used
# when generating formulas in HTML.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

LATEX_BATCHMODE        = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the dot tool
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: NO.

HAVE_DOT               = YES

# If the COLLABORATION_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a
# graph for each documented class showing the direct and indirect implementation
# dependencies (inheritance, containment, and class references variables) of the
# class with other documented classes.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

COLLABORATION_GRAPH    = NO

# If the UML_LOOK tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate inheritance and
# collaboration diagrams in a style similar to the OMG's Unified Modeling
# Language.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.

UML_LOOK               = YES
