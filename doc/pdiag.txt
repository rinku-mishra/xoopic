Boundaries can be made to keep track of particles which hit them.
In XOOPIC, any boundary with this diagnostic on will cause 
graphs to appear in the diagnostics list.  Be sure to give
the boundary a name.

The particles are counted up by velocity.  If the particle
doesn't fall in between v[x]start and v[x]end
([x] is 1, 2, or 3) it is not counted in that diagnostic.

At present only one species can have diagnostics collected
per boundary.
