Someone successfully got XOOPIC working with Solaris 2.5
and SunSoft C++ 4.1.


He had to change the makefiles to use the new compiler,
and compile the advisor with debugging and no optimization.

He also had to make sure that 
#include <stdlib.h>
was uncommented in xg/list.h

Versions higher than XOOPIC 2.0 should work without
modification with SunSoft C++ 4.2.
