High-energy electron bunch enters a quiet plasma in cylindrical geometry --
Modeling the SLAC "afterburner" concept of Tom Katsouleas.

This input file includes the effects of electron-impact ionization
and elastic scattering by the beam electrons.

Collisional effects are ignored for the plasma electrons.


This simulation models a beam-plasma wake-field accelerator:
a)  The background plasma is pre-ionized.  Ions are assumed stationary.
b)  Beam density exceeds electron plasma density, so the beam "blows out"
    plasma electrons near the symmetry axis.
c)  The electron beam is Gaussian in z and r.
e)  The electron beam is overfocussed by these fields and so executes
    betatron oscillations;  however, the focussing force varies axially.

Moving window:
a)  Once the electron beam has entered the grid and is close to the far
    edge of the simulation region, a moving window algorithm is invoked
    so that the beam can be modeled for long times.

Boundary conditions:
a)  The simulation region must be bounded by either conductors or
    insulators, in order to capture lost particles.
b)  Conductors were chosen, to avoid any charge build up.
c)  The choice of conducting boundary conditions means that electric
    fields parallel to the boundaries are forced to zero;  however,
    fields near the boundaries of the simulation must be small anyway
    to accurately model a semi-infinite plasma, so this is OK.
